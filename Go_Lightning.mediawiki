===Using the wallet===

The Zap wallet, as wallet, is a lightning node.

It runs neutrino and lnd, the golang implementation of lightning network.

The use the wallet you need funds on the base layer or on the second layer.

Funds on the base layer are bitcoin that you can send from any other base layer wallet or even a exchange where you buy bitcoin.

Funds on the second layer are funds in lighthing channels. Right now you can have outgoing channels and incoming channels.

===Ligthning channels===

'''Incoming channels'''

Incoming channels are channels from other lightning node to yours. And these channels allow you to receive.

'''Outgoing channels'''

Outgoing channels are channels from your node to others node. And these channels allow you to send.

You can have many channels of both types.

But since Zap wallet is lightweight wallet, I will recommend only one of each type.

If you have a full bitcoin node instead of neutrino with a lightning software implementation that is always running, you can should have more channels.

There already a few easy solutions to run these type of nodes in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip SoC machines].

Raspiblitz is DIY.

myNode is DIY or you can buy the full working version of it with support.

Casa is a full working version of with support.


You can also install all the software by hand in any type of hardware. Since it is open source.

To open an outgoing channel you just need some bitcoin in your wallet and connect to another lightning node. Some wallets even have autopilot to does exactly this.

To have a incoming channel you have to ask someone to open it, your wait or you can use Bitrefill and buy a Thor lightning channel capacity.

Of course if you a real beginner, most likely you will not have any bitcoin at all. Not even to pay in the Bitrefill website.

The easy way to do it, if you don't worry to much with AML and KYC, is using a regular exchange.

Like [https://pro.coinbase.com/ Coinbase]

You can connect the Coinbase account directly to your bank account.

Your can use a intermediary, like  [https://www.revolut.com/en-PT/  Revolut]  for UE citizens.

Just register in both sites and then associate the Revolut account to Coinbase.

Then, send some money to Revolut. And then from Revolut to Coinbase.

After having money in Coinbase, just make a order a buy bitcoin.
