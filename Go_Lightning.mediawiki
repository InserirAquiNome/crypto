===Using the wallet===

The Zap wallet, as wallet, is a lightning node.

It runs neutrino and lnd, the golang implementation of lightning network.

The use the wallet you need funds on the base layer or on the second layer.

Funds on the base layer are bitcoin that you can send from any other base layer wallet or even a exchange where you buy bitcoin.

Funds on the second layer are funds in lighthing channels. Right now you can have outgoing channels and incoming channels.

====Ligthning channels====

'''Incoming channels'''

Incoming channels are channels from other lightning node to yours. And these channels allow you to receive.

'''Outgoing channels'''

Outgoing channels are channels from your node to others node. And these channels allow you to send.

You can have many channels of both types.

But since Zap wallet is lightweight wallet, I will recommend only one of each type.

If you have a full bitcoin node instead of neutrino with a lightning software implementation that is always running, you can should have more channels.

There already a few easy solutions to run these type of nodes in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip SoC machines].
