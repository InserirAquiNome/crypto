# Trading

***For now this will remain in  the branch draft of my git repository!!!**

## First entry, 17 February 2018

I'm not a professional investor and trader. 

I'm a self taught investor and trader. 

And this part of my journey as a bitcoin and altcoins futures investor.

I use the bitmex platform for trading https://www.bitmex.com/app/trade/XBTUSD

The date is 7 February 2018 and I only have a few months as trader. I don't much so I don't risk much, because I am learning to trade. And learning comes at a cost and I avoid that my lessons burn all my budget available to trade.

So for my first lesson is small positions with only 10x leverage, when I see a ROE of 25% a put my stop on the entry price. But in the beginning I put that stop on half way between the entry price and the liquidation price.

In this way, when I get burn I only loose half of my position.

After the big bull run at the end of the last year and so much new blood in the space, we are facing lot of volatility. Because the new blood is the first to sell and they sell on panic. And the honey badger is still thirsty for blood. If I start to take I lot of damage I will stop for while and make a break. I will think on what I am doing and on my methods and evaluate everything. 

And if you are reading this now and don't want to trade, just hodl and enjoy the ride.

If you want to trade, try to learn with my mistakes and advises!

Can you trust me!?

NO!

We, bitcoin minimalists don't trust no one! We verify!

And that's why we run full bitcoin nodes, because we verify everything...

Have fun!
