# Bitcoin full node

![alt text](https://github.com/InserirAquiNome/crypto/blob/master/static/image/full_node1.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")

This is a setup of a bitcoin full node running on a RPi3 hardware. I run other nodes but this is my first bitcoin full node on an ARM machine.

My RPi3 run a Linux OS, without X.

I use it through SSH.

## Download the client

On https://bitcoin.org/en/download or https://bitcoin.org/bin/

`$ wget https://bitcoin.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.15.1/bitcoin-0.15.1-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz`

`$ wget https://bitcoin.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.15.1/SHA256SUMS.asc`

## Check the client integrity and authenticity

```bash
$ sha256sum --ignore-missing -c SHA256SUMS.asc 
bitcoin-0.15.1-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz: OK
sha256sum: WARNING: 20 lines are improperly formatted
```

Integrity is checked and now I will check it's authenticity, like I wrote on my [PGP.md](https://github.com/InserirAquiNome/crypto/blob/master/PGP.md)

`$ gpg --gen-key`

And in [where](https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#other-linux-distributions) get the public key I want to verify. 

`$ wget https://bitcoin.org/laanwj-releases.asc`

But the website says 

```
If you know how to use PGP, you should also click the Verify Release Signatures link on the download page to download a signed list of SHA256 file hashes. The 0.11 and later releases are signed by Wladimir J. van der Laanâ€™s releases key with the fingerprint:

01EA 5486 DE18 A882 D4C2  6845 90C8 019E 36C2 E964
```

Let check that

```bash
$ gpg --with-fingerprint laanwj-releases.asc 
pub  4096R/36C2E964 2015-06-24 Wladimir J. van der Laan (Bitcoin Core binary release signing key) <laanwj@gmail.com>
      Key fingerprint = 01EA 5486 DE18 A882 D4C2  6845 90C8 019E 36C2 E964
```

It's correct!
So will import it to my keyring and sign it.

```bash
$ gpg --import laanwj-releases.asc 
gpg: key 36C2E964: public key "Wladimir J. van der Laan (Bitcoin Core binary release signing key) <laanwj@gmail.com>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1  (RSA: 1)
gpg: 3 marginal(s) needed, 1 complete(s) needed, PGP trust model
gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
```
```
$ gpg --list-keys
$ gpg --sign-key 36C2E964
```

Let's check if the software is authentic.

 ```
$ gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc 
gpg: Signature made Sat 11 Nov 2017 13:52:22 WET using RSA key ID 36C2E964
gpg: checking the trustdb
gpg: 3 marginal(s) needed, 1 complete(s) needed, PGP trust model
gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   1  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
gpg: depth: 1  valid:   1  signed:   0  trust: 1-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 0u
gpg: next trustdb check due at 2019-02-14
gpg: Good signature from "Wladimir J. van der Laan (Bitcoin Core binary release signing key) <laanwj@gmail.com>"
 ```

## Extracting the file

Extract the file

`$ tar zpvfx bitcoin-0.15.1-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz`

Some people run the client as root or create a new user just for that. I will run it with my regular user.

`$ vim ~/.bash_profile`

And add this at the end

```
#PATH to bitcoin client
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/BITCOIN/bitcoin-0.15.1/bin/
```

Be aware to not leave any blank space at the end of that file.

## Configuration

Create the ~/.bitcoin directory 

`$ mkdir ~/.bitcoin`

And now I need to create a bitcoin.conf file inside that directory. I already have one from my other full nodes so will upload the final version on git repo and in here I will say what I changed.

I will use only one core of my RPi3 cpu

```
# Bitcoin Core daemon
bitcoind -par=1 -daemon

# Bitcoin Core GUI
bitcoin-qt -par=1
```

I will not store the full blockchain on my node and for that I will prune the old blocks. The only storage size I will use is 600 M of disk space.

```
# Reduce storage requirements by pruning (deleting) old blocks. This mode is incompatible with -txindex and -rescan. 
# Warning: Reverting this setting requires re-downloading the entire blockchain. 
# (default: 0 = disable pruning blocks, >550 = target size in MiB to use for block files)
prune=600
```
This is my node comment.
```
# Node comment
uacomment=This-is-my-node-and-I-choose-what-is-bitcoin
```

## Misc 

I will not store the blockchain on the RPi sdcard, because this will read and write a lot of times on my sd card and can damage it. I will use an USB memory stick to store the blocks.

```
$ cd ~/storage/
$ mkdir blocks
$ mkdir chainstate
$ cd ~/.bitcoin/
$ ln -s ~/storage/blocks/
$ ln -s ~/storage/chainstate/
```

I have a script called *bitcoinsync.sh* and another called *tor.sh* that I will download to my RPi3

```
$ cd ~/programming/Raspberry_RPi3/scripts/
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InserirAquiNome/crypto/master/bash/bitcoinsync.sh
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InserirAquiNome/crypto/master/bash/tor.sh
$ chmod +x bitcoinsync.sh tor.sh
```

And now I will add some alias to my .bashrc

```
alias BTC_start="source ~/.bashrc ; bitcoind -daemon -disablewallet"

alias BTC_stop="source ~/.bashrc ; bitcoin-cli stop"

alias BTC_status="source ~/.bashrc ; /home/pi/programming/Raspberry_RPi3/scripts/bitcoinsync.sh ; /home/pi/tor.sh ; du -sh /home/pi/storage/blocks/"
```

And start the node

```
$ BTC_start
Bitcoin server starting
```

Let's check if is everything ok!

The node is being pruned? 

```
$ du -sh ~/.bitcoin/blocks/
56M     /home/pi/.bitcoin/blocks/

$ BTC_status

How much time will take to sync the node??? 

## Syncing the node 

Already pass some time but the blockchain is at the moment around 160GB and my node have to sync it all.

It's not an expensive hardware. Only a $35 hardware + power adapter + sdcard + USB memory stick. And there it is, everything we need to guarantee your financial sovereignty!

In meanwhile I am listening some music on it, just waiting to full sync my node.

I think will also configure tor on it!

I will leave some link about that.

**Update** 

It passed almost 24 hours since the last time posted my node progress syncing the full blockchain.

It's not fast because I am using only one core, like you can see on bitcoin.conf. But at least the system load is low.

But I am receiving a full blockchain that is pruned after 600M. It started from the beginning of the blockchain and goes until the current block. Now I am at 57% of blockchain and I think that this blocks are still not full. So it will not put a lot of load on the computer for now. Maybe around 75% I will see some increase on my system load. Let's see at happens until then.

I could be doing this in a different way. I already have a full blockchain on my personal computer. I could just copy that blockchain to the RPi3 and I think doing that would be faster. But I prefer to test this like if this was my only hardware available for my full node. And for that I will sync the all blockchain.

**Update**

I changed somethings on my .bashrc to get better stats.

```
function BTC_status () {

  source ~/.bashrc

  process="bitcoind"
  pidof -s "$process" > /dev/null 2>&1
  status=$?

  if [[ "$status" -eq 0 ]]; then
    printf "\n"
    echo "$process is running"
    printf "\n"
    uname -a
    printf "\n"
    date
    printf "\n"
    uptime
    printf "\n"
    /home/pi/programming/Raspberry_RPi3/scripts/bitcoinsync.sh
    /home/pi/tor.sh
    du -sh /home/pi/storage/blocks/
    du -sh /home/pi/storage/chainstate/
  else
    echo "$process is NOT running"
  fi

}

```

The output of this change it this

```
$ BTC_status

## Thanks

Many thanks to all the men and women working on the development of bitcoin. Thanks for improving bitcoin with your work and thanks for beside all the improvement that we have and will have in this project in the future, everyone can run it in their own homes with inexpensive hardware.

People need to learn the value of having a network like this that runs on every hardware that anyone can afford. 

If the bitcoin network remains decentralized like today, it will never die. Because for that they need to shutdown node by node and make sure that node anyone of those nodes comes back online.

Plz! Run a full bitcoin node and experience bitcoin and try to see beyond the price. I guarantee that will help you to face corrections and pullbacks because then you will know it will go up again.
