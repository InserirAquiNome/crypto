## About bitcoin

Bitcoin is an experiment! We never tried something like this before. 

There is some simple rules and steps,  on bitcoin that most people don't realize:

  * Don't spend more money that you can afford to loose.
  
  * Buy every time you can with the previous condition in mind. Personally I buy bitcoin every month in two different occasions. One in the beginning of the month and other one a dip. In each one I use 50% of my monthly budget for buying bitcoin.
  
  * Put every bitcoin in cold storage. Use a TREZOR wallet https://trezor.io/ for safety. 

    There is also cold storage wallets solutions in software like Armory wallet but this one needs two different computers https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory/releases/ 

 * Follow this two rules
 
   1. Ignore the FUD
  
   2. HODL on every correction and buy on corrections/or dips
   
   3. [Learn about bitcoin and why is different from any cryptocurrency](#more-about-bitcoin)
  
   And you most likely will reach the top of the S curve:

#### Note: If you loose your private key or your seed key, you can't sign any transactions and your bitcoins are lost forever.  Managing private keys in bitcoin is a problem because some people loose them. And there is only 21M bitcoins available, you can't afford to loose something so scarce.
