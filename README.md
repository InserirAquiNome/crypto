## About bitcoin

Bitcoin is an experiment! We never tried something like this before. 

There is some simple rules on bitcoin that most people don't realize:

  * Don't spend more money that you can afford to loose.
  * Buy every time you can with the previous condition in mind. Personally I buy bitcoin every month in two different occasions. One in the beginning of the month and other one a dip. In each one I use 50% of my monthly budget for buying bitcoin
  * Put every bitcoin in cold storage. Use a TREZOR wallet https://trezor.io/ for safety. 

 There is also cold storage wallets solutions in software like Armory wallet but this one needs two different computers https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory/releases/
