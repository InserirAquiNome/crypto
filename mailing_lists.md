# Mailing lists

How to use mailing lists on your computer.

## Definition

A mailing list is a collection of names and addresses used by an individual or
an organization to send material to multiple recipients. The term is often
extended to include the people subscribed to such a list, so the group of
subscribers is referred to as "the mailing list", or simply "the list".
