# Armory 

## A short introduction

This is some of my personal notes from my own experience on build the Armory wallet software.

Armory wallet supports cold storage and for that purpose you need to keep you private keys offline. That's the definition of cold storage.
This means that you need a machine that will remain offline since the OS and Armory wallet was installed. This machine can't ever touch the internet again.
Because there is a physical separation from this machine to the internet it's called an air gaped machine. This machine is also called the signer machine because it signs the transactions. The only way that a machine can sign a transaction is because it's holds the private keys.
And that's the problem with wallets that keep the private keys online if someone steals the private keys they can sign your transactions and move your bitcoin around.

Using Armory with two machines is not easy but Armory is a very power full software.

The Armory wallet with cold storage needs to machines: the offline machine or signer and the online machine.

The online machine needs to run a full bitcoin node.

Most people holding bitcoin aren't running full nodes and which means they are trusting someone to provide the balance of their address. Only running a full node allows trust less interaction with bitcoin.

Most bitcoin users are using wallets that are SPV wallets like TREZOR, electrum and etc... Trezor is completely trusted website. You CAN choose your own server, but its hard. But TREZOR is still one of the best hardware wallets solutions available at the moment.

To full understand the revolution means you need to run a full node.
I will provide some links why this matters:

The most popular bitcoin client is the reference client or the satoshi client also called bitcoin core:

https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

https://bitcoincore.org/

https://bitcoin.org/bin/

**Always check the integrity and authenticity of any software downloaded from the internet**

Besides the reference client there is alternatives like knots and bitcoinj. All this clients came to consensus on the bitcoin network agreeing what are the rules of the network, or in other words this clients vote on the network on what is bitcoin.

We can say that bitcoin is a voting system totally decentralized and it's first application was a financial system. But similar systems based on the same principles can be used for voting, taking decisions, government and so much more.
This is the revolution of bitcoin as decentralized and incorruptible voting system. And are still grasping it's power.
Bitcoin is a young technology and it's needs to grow, scale and embrace every challenge on it's path.

In our days we ear everyone talking about bitcoin and the blockchain revolution. 
Governments and banks say that the true revolution is the blockchain. In other words their blockchain and a voting system centralized here only a few can say what is valid or not.
And if you believe them, you will not understand what is the bitcoin and what it matters so much.
